  Rule functions will be invoked with a rule context map containing the
  following keys:

  - :entity, the entity owning this rule (as indicated by 'entity-id' here)
  - :entity-id, the value passed as 'entity-id' to this function
  - :index, the index of the rule within its parent entity
  - :event, the event in question (see 'dispatch' above for structure)
  - :game, containing the current value of the :game key of the 'state' atom

  The rule should return a sequence of Effects (see 'handle-effect' for
  structure) to mutate the state of the game in some way.

  Rule vars should have attached metadata which indicates when the rule
  function should be invoked. All rules must have an :event metadata key
  indicating the event name for which this rule should be invoked.

  Rules can also optionally have a :trigger metadata key, which indicates when
  this rule should be invoked. Note that triggers are only considered for
  events which have an associated :entites list. Events with no entities are
  called 'global events' and always run all rules. Possible trigger values are:

  - :entity, meaning it should run when its entity appears in the :entities
    list of the event. This is the default behavior.
  - :global, indicating the rule should run every time the event fires
  - :source, meaning it should run when its entity appears in the :source
    list of the event

  longer exist will not be invoked."
